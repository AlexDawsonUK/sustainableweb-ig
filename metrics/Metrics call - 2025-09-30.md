# Metrics call - 2025-09-30

**Attendees:** _Alexander Dawson, Fershad Irani, ≈Åukasz Mastalerz, Adam Newman_

**Minutes:**

- General updates:
  - Fershad noted that he will be away for the next 3 weeks, and then is uncertain about availability from November to February 2026.
  - Alex mentioned that we have had a first round of review within the W3C and have beginning to draft a note.

- We worked mostly within this spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hqzz3SmGbU23vwen-Ugcxf3_iYxEDVW-Lu3Uxw_z0TU/edit?usp=sharing
- Initially, worked with the current four GRI categories (CO2, Energy, Water, Materials) and went discussed four guidelines to rank them as "high", "medium", "low" impact for each of those categories.
  - 5.8	Implement sustainability onboarding guidelines
  - 5.17	Share economic benefits
  - 5.23	Include responsible financial policies
  - 5.24	Include organizational philanthropy policies
- This process was a trial, and after completing the four guidelines above we discussed as a group how we felt about the approach overall. This surface some very high quality conversation.

- Adam suggested that the process of using GRI would be a good first pass, but there will be questions about the nuance about different impacts for guidelines. For some the range of impact could be from "low" through to "high" based on a whole range of criteria, and it's not entirely clear how we capture this. 
  - Alex replied that nuance will come from the Success Criteria, but even within those there's vagueness in those as they are still general rather than overly perscriptive.
  - Fershad reminded the group that we are covering the entirety of the web, and there'll be edge cases & nuance for _every guideline_. We need to accept that as a part of this process, we don't have the ability to prescribe specific implementation in the same way technical specs might.
  - Alex added that tooling can also help assist with untangling the nuance. See Mike Gifford's tool is a starter down this path. Definitely something for the future that the do with the metrics.
- Adam suggested that perhaps we just treat each guideline as equal & just make it a checklist that people have to go through in order to achieve a certain level of conformance.
  - Fershad noted that we still need a way to come up with _prioritisation_ for the metrics. This process is a means to that ends, we don't necessarily _need_ publish the underlying ratings.
- Adam agreed, suggested then that we remove GRI, because we only capture a subset of the total GRI categories and they are all things that in reality _should_ be supported with data/measurements which is something we're not doing as part of this rating process.
  - Adam suggested we potentially use ESG instead & give a HML potential for each of those.
  - Fershad suggested what about People, Planet, Prosperity (PPP) instead? It's a theme in the guidelines that can flow throughout the doc.
  - Alex noted that we went with GRI initially because it is already a standard that's included in legislation etc. Companies are already familiar with.
  - Alex also mentioned that in earlier versions of the guidelines ESG terminology got some pushback during review and comes with baggage. We settled on PPP.
  - Adam noted that what we're doing is already high level, so why not use a higher level breakdown for impacts which is what PPP would be. It's not highly scientific, but it represents what we're trying to do with the guidelines. Below PPP there's the possibility to get more granular with metrics & map GRI categories to either People, Planet, Prosperity - but that is an exercise for later.
  - **Collectively agreed to try out shifting to PPP for metrics/prioritisation.**
- Fershad mentioned that this is something we should raise with the group on Thursday.
- We then updated the working spreadsheet, and tried going through one guideline as an example.
- Alex suggested we use the existing GRI ratings for each guideline to generate the rating for the "Planet" bucket of PPP since the GRI buckets we currently have are all environmentally focused.

**Next steps**

- Share update with the IG during Thursday's call.
- Over the next week or two, go through the spreadsheet at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hqzz3SmGbU23vwen-Ugcxf3_iYxEDVW-Lu3Uxw_z0TU/edit?usp=sharing to assign "low", "medium", "high" rankings to each guideline under the PPP categories.

**Next meeting**
Tuesday 7th October, 11am UK time (10am UTC).
