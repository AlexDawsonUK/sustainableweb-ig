# W3C Sustainable Web Interest Group
Welcome to the repository for the [W3C Sustainable Web Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/).

## Mission

Digital Sustainability is an evolving field that is complex and undergoing significant change due to technological advances such as Artificial Intelligence and legislative shifts. The complexity of these rapid changes increases the need and urgency to provide guidance for those expected to meet climate-related goals and targets.

The mission of the [W3C Sustainable Web Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/sustainableweb/) is to improve digital sustainability so that the Web works better for all people and the planet.

We do this through advancing the development of the [Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG)](https://w3c.github.io/sustainableweb-wsg/), its [supplementary materials](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg), and advocacy work (in digital sustainability) to educate and advise on any implementations of our work and its importance in the context of their organizations.

### History

![Timeline of the W3C Sustainable Web Interest Group's history from Community Group to it's current status.](timeline.svg)

Formed in 2013, the [Sustainable Web Design Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/) brought together like-minded individuals from various backgrounds with a passion for sustainability. While it originally served as a method of sharing useful resources on digital sustainability, the need to do more for both people and the planet urged the group to start regular Zoom meetings, and a plan was formed.

Organizing into five committees (based on the four categories noted in the WSGs and a team focused on metrics), the community group spent three years carefully writing and cultivating the Web Sustainability Guidelines into its current Draft Report.

As a W3C Interest group we continue the work of this Community Group, further improving upon the hard work that has been achieved over this period.
