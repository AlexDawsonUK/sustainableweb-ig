     - **Alex:** [/tr done!](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-sustainability-guidelines/) ([Press](https://www.w3.org/news/2025/web-sustainability-guidelines-wsg-becomes-a-first-public-draft-note/))
	 	- Officially listed among web standards info now - we’re live!
      - **Alex:** Horizontal Review needs to be prioritized now.
      - **Sid:** [#133: Sid’s proposal for adding sections](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/133)
	  	- Overall great reception. Maybe some small adjustments to make within the groups.
      - **Andrew** asks: Is there anything missing from the current version of the guidelines that would cause us to lose credibility if we released them without adding it?
	  Jen: Yes! As we discussed in the UXTF on Friday, we must add a bit about AI. We have a bit on emerging technologies, but given the intensity at the moment, perhaps we could add something more, um, direct/explicit? Maybe we should continue to discuss in a Github issue so that we do not lose the content of our conversation. 
    	- **Rose**: It’s a good question to ask everybody. In UX, it is missing. There is the Importance of including GenAI features, but also AI-generated content.
    	- **Chris**: I recommend we don’t edit anything else now. We don’t need to be larger at the moment.
    	Anne : Isn't there something missing in the line of "pick the lightest solution to answer your user's needs"? (image > video, form > chatbot, algorithm > AI,…) Contrary to existing criteria, it is broader than just about optimizing or doing things right. It is about functionalities definition at early stages, about the "what" rather than the "how". Such a criteria could either be in Product strategy or UX. 
    	- **Lukasz**: If we choose to leave some content apart like AI, we should document why we chose to leave it aside.
    	- **Alex**: In 5.22, we wrote about "merging technologies" because there are a lot of new technologies, and not only genAI. In a limited length of text, it is hard to be specific about one technology and not the others. There is also a risk of loopholes. 
    	- **Anne**:  "AI" or "genAI" is not "emerging" anymore and therefore not covered by 5.22.
    	- **Emma**: the technologies will change quicker than we can update the guidelines
      - **Alex:** New section to come: Relationship to https://www.w3.org/TR/webmachinelearning-ethics/
