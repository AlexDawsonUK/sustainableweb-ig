       - Thanks to Rose and Andrew for their work on the UX document
       - Decided on a colour code for linguistic changes (shade in yellow) and for global changes (shade in blue) - colour coding advice at the top of the spreadsheet

  - Notes:

    - One of the key goals of the 19th meeting is figuring out how to get this section in shape to get it accepted as an _advisory note.
    - We have some folks able to join at the 17:30 point
- Measurability:
  - In last Tuesday’s meeting, Measurability TF has created a [spreadsheet](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/)

    - Identify any things that are straightforward to measure, e.g. minification is binary measurement

    - Can always adjust measurability

  - Tzviya: Looking at webdev section -- How are we tying back the definitions to our criteria

  - Alex: Come up with a set of predefined characteristics that we want to look for that improve sustainability, backed up by evidence-based material, and a sort of metric/measurement of it, e.g. amount of bandwidth production can be done across all of success criteria, how much bandwidth reduction do all of the SC present? Contribute to their overall score.

  - Ryan: Does this make it more complicated?

  - Alex: It reduces complexity if you’re predefining certain things. Gives us a specific threshold for what we’re working in.

  - Tzviya: How do we fill out the spreadsheet? How would I assess how each one of these are low or medium?

  - Alex: Assume best guess based on what we know about sustainability. Do we think that this would be high, medium, or low, based on what we know? Because we’re time-pressured we have to do this ad-hoc style; would be better to have a more rigorous way to do this.

  - Tzviya: We need information in order to make a decision on whether something is high or medium or low.

  - Alex: The only way we can gather that kind of evidence, there’s a lot of best practices or assumed knowledge based on what we know about sustainability and its ramifications and indirect consequences-- the only way to put this into practice would be through tooling. We need to create a tool that would go through these SCs and to say if we want to test certain things like CPU, GPU, bandwidth, and test against a cohort of websites, do some benchmarking. Need to gather data from a larger scale. 

  - Alex has list of variables at https://websitesustainability.com/cache/files/variables.pdf

  - Ryan: Should we write down those assumptions? Make another list?

  Next step - figure out which variables to cross-index for GRI info in Fershad's spreadsheet
