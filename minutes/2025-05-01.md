       - May be useful for the sustainability-infra group

   - Asim

     - intro’d SCI, geared away from reporting totals and towards measurable units of functionality (to drive action). Requires drawing of boundaries around functionality. The larger the boundary the less responsibility (and action). The tighter the boundary the more accountable (encourages more action). Example scenario this addresses - “it is possible to optimise for energy and emissions but sales go up and totals go up” so you can’t optimise against totals. SCI addresses this by reducing to measurable (and repeatable) units of functionality that can be compared like for like. Consider personas: engineering vs energy. Energy team mandated to reduce emissions from energy demand (through procurement of market contracts). Engineers need to make decisions independent of the energy team’s mandate.

     - SCI for AI. New proposal (no consensus). 2 personas, provider / consumer. Functional unit examples per token, per second, per execution. Focus is not how much emissions from AI, focus on who are the personas, what they do and measuring that.

   - Collab with SCI for Web (Chris Adams - / Asim Hussain)

     - TS W3C rep. AD rep too. Do we adopt any model(s) that emerge from that group? Which bits are relevant to the guidelines?

     - AH: assemblies (workshops) gather feedback (personas, actions first then metrics to be worked out over longer periods). This group can feedback through TS / AD. Regular (e.g. quarterly) syncs (no decisions to not break bylaws)

     - CA: workshops will be announced soon

     - TS: possibly GSF people to be involved in this W3C group

## Major sections (Blockers & Updates)

   - UX - Thorsten raised a question around Workflow resolution, [2.4](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/issues/54). UX task force workflow discussion (transitioning from Miro to Google Docs), as [noted in these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cpiz8qZvJIxzcfk5ygCXVi_fd7nOT_GdqjHd5-zoMXg/edit?usp=sharing), and asking folks to contribute contents on the existing guidelines by [noting in one’s individual column in this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10BrvQPLAsvChJ2TKm2LUx-oDIsibM0ltw_Q08ie85KA/edit?usp=sharing)

   - WebDev -

   - Infrastructure -

   - Business -

   - Measurability - Figure out how prioritization of SCs works.

     - AN: comment about the difference between general guidelines and bespoke guidelines (application level context) and how do we bridge that in measurability of SCs. TBD in measurability TF.

     - Adam: put in a suggestion of how to look at each criteria a. Is the consumer of the guidelines looking for general advice or specific -

## Other discussion/questions

   - [Alex’s tagging spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wa_kTpAqF1n1fQKDlmV1kgXlqAWR1nTKd_FG3nTAq-8/edit?usp=sharing)

     - Alex working on **standards** (sorting Reference links into a supplement).

     - TFs please verify & correct **considerations** & **categories**. (If more categories or titles are required, feel free to suggest!)

     - TFs please categorize by **Job Title** (you can use more than one!). (If more categories or titles are required, feel free to suggest!)

   - **Mike:** Impact / Effort Scoring:\
     A/AA/AAA, red/yellow/green, gold/silver/bronze, A-F, High-Low. - delayed until next meeting

   - TS: if anyone needs help with meetings in between or async work TS can help facilitate!
