   - Virtual “F2F” ([17 July at 13:00 UTC](https://www.w3.org/events/meetings/50f52dc7-cb20-4094-a8da-005352b64954/20250717T140000/)) 9am/ chicago time/10AM Eastern (same time as regular meeting)
     - Opportunity for subject specific deep dive
     - 2.5 hr time commitment associated this time, as a final push. Come even if you can't attend the whole meeting.
     - Please bring notes / new success criteria / ideas

   - [TPAC 2025](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-ig/issues/53) - Thursday Nov 13
     - TPAC itself runs from Nov 10 -14. We will meet on Thu, Nov 13
     - This is happening in Japan, and it’s best to assume the whole day, Japan time.
     - There is now a room dedicated to sustainability track on Thursday
     - Meeting happens on Thursday, but TPAC runs the whole week
     - Specific Meetings with agendas shared ahead of time for
       - Accessibility Guidelines Group
       - WeB Performance Group
     - Time Commitment
       - The whole day is dedicated to TPAC, but it’s not essential to be there the whole day.
     - Expected attendance (in person)
       - Tzviya
       - Fershad Iran
       - Kazuhito
       - Hidde
       - Mike Gifford, CivicActions
       - Virtual attendance is v welcome, and well provisioned - better than most hybrid events, so if you can’t fly to Japan, there is still scope to contribute.

     - If you can’t cover the travel there is an inclusion fund which makes it possible to cover the cost of attendance for a small number of people - enquire with Tzviya

   - [Q2 2025 Release Notes](https://github.com/w3c/sustainableweb-wsg/releases) (Available 30th June)

     - There is a new quarterly release coming
     - There is no explicit release in terms of v1, v2, as the WSGs are classed as an “evergreen” document.
     - But we have a more “CalDev” approach, where we take a named snapshot for a given quarter.
     - (A bit like “CalVer” over “SemVer”)
     - The goal is work towards something like the equivalent to the “first public working draft” in W3C working groups, and this quarterly release would ideally incorporate some horizontal review (please correct this if I got this bit wrong - Chris)

3. Task Force Breakouts

   - Group Feedback (Blockers & Updates)
   - UX:
     - Discussed stronger cross-section (silo) connections. My fave example is “page budgets” - setting data limits - may start as a policy, then be with UX & UI to figure out in collaboration with webdev, then webdev does further web performance optimisation; product manager closes the loop.
     - We looked at Thorsten’s spreadsheet of WSG UX feedback and added a bunch of stuff.
     - Discussed briefly the idea of structuring
   - WebDev: 
     - Didn’t meet
   - Hosting:
     - Didn’t meet
   - Product/Biz:
     - One of the key things raised was how the product / biz section received the majority of the pushback when converting from a community group to an interest / working group was proposed.
     - Outside this IG, the broad scope of the recommendations about how the organisation was run, and the difficulty of assessment was seen as a sticking point.
   - Measurability:
     - Didn’t meet
